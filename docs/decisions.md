# Decisions

One line per non-obvious choice and why. Appended at the end of each phase.

## Phase 0 — Repo setup

- Repo had no git history yet, so `git init` was run fresh rather than assuming
  prior tracking; all files were moved with plain `mv` (nothing was tracked to
  warrant `git mv`).
- `.env.example` was not among the original flat files. Rather than guess its
  contents, it was added in a follow-up commit with empty `LEAGUE_ID`,
  `ESPN_S2`, `SWID` keys matching exactly what `scripts/fetch_fixture.py`
  reads via `os.environ`.
- Repo was pushed to GitHub as **public**, not private as this file's Phase 0
  section specifies. Deliberate deviation, confirmed with the project owner —
  left public rather than changed after the fact.
- `scripts/fetch_fixture.py`'s scrubber originally only pseudonymized GUIDs
  found under a dict key named `id`. ESPN also emits SWID-shaped GUIDs as bare
  list entries (`teams[].owners`) and plain fields (`teams[].primaryOwner`),
  which that version would have written to disk unscrubbed. Fixed to match any
  string value shaped like a GUID, regardless of which key holds it, and to
  report the JSON path of anything that still survives (`find_leaks`) instead
  of only aborting. Verified against the current `fixtures/league_raw_2026.json`:
  no secret key names and no bare identity GUIDs present — the only
  GUID-shaped strings left are ESPN CDN team-logo asset ids embedded inside
  `teams[].logo` URLs, which are not identity data.
